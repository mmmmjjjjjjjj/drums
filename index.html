  <h2>ABOUT</h2>
</p>
<div class="scroll">
<p>
  <br>Max Jaffe expands the boundaries of possibility for composition 
  and collaboration through the drum set. His music draws from many different 
  genres and seeks to break down the boundaries between them. He is part of a cutting edge
  of drummers that have embraced <a href="https://sunhou.se/artists" target="blank">SUNHOUSE</a> and their Sensory Percussion technology that
  has shifted the paradigm of the instrument. His powerful solo performances
  exploit the physicality of the drums to create narrative through movement,
  defying visual expectations and logic for what a “drum solo” can express.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a collaborator, he is a longtime member of experimental rock collective <a href="https://www.jobsband.net" target="blank">JOBS</a>
  and was a founding member of Amirtha Kidambi's Elder Ones, Leverage Models, and several other groups.
  He has also recorded and performed with Chrome Sparks, Peter Evans, Rubblebucket, Delicate Steve, Ava Mendoza, JBL Trio, Cass McCombs,
  and many others. He is currently on tour with <a href="https://iameden.eu/" target="blank">EDEN</a>.
  <br>
  <br>In 2021 he completed an MFA from California Institute of the Arts in
  Music Technology and was a Pioneer Works Music Resident.
